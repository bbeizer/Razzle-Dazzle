# Razzle-Dazzle

This is a game I made up. Each side has 4 pieces. All of the pieces move like knights and one piece contains a metal ball
The piece with the ball is not able to move but it is able to pass the ball. That piece can pass the ball other pieces that are
laterally or diagonally in range as long as the oponnent's piece is not blocking the path. The first player to get one of their piece on the opponents
back rank with the ball wins

# Bugs/Future Improvement

I wish I could network the code and have the game running on a server and have user clients interact with the game on the server
